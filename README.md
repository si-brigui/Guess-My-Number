### Guess My Number! ðŸŽ¯

A tiny browser game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
You try to guess a secret number between 1 and 20. After each guess, the app tells you if itâ€™s too high or too low, updates your score, and tracks your highscore for the session.

Built as part of Jonas Schmedtmannâ€™s Complete JavaScript Course on Udemy.
